This manual was written by Vítor Santos Costa,

manual is largely based on the DECsystem-10 Prolog User's Manual by
D.L. Bowen, L. Byrd, F. C. N. Pereira, L. M. Pereira, and
D. H. D. Warren. We have  used comments from the Edinburgh Prolog
library written by R. O'Keefe. Documentation from many built-ins is
originally from the SWI-Prolog manual, with the gracious authorization
from
Jan Wielemaker. We would also like to gratefully
acknowledge the contributions from Ashwin Srinivasian.
