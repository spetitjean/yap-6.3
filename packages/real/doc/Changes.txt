    Fixed   x <- list().   on Swi 7.
	 Cushioned Yap use by wrapping thread_self/1 to real_thread_self/1.

1:1:0       2014/02/15    (thankless_task)
	Added support for threaded execution.
	We need to look into environments to make deployment easier.

1:0:4       2014/12/25
	Fixed passing unamed R lists to Prolog pairs. Missing name is the number
	position. Added example for that.

0:1:2       2013 November 3   (the_stoic)
   Added support for a[x,y] and a().
	Corrected some branch variables, thanks to new Swi warnings.
	Jan, added some stuff on strings support. 

0:1:1       2013 January 17   (cross_compiled)
	swipl-win.exe doesnot use the std I/O streams. So <-print/1 doesnot display
	on console. Added message that only displays when Prolog was started with
	swipl-win.exe and only once. The windows dlls are now cross compiled. 
	There are now also shared (.so) libs for linux i386 and x86_64.
	Added Makefile.swi to the sources.
